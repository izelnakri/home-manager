# TODO: discard keybinding doest work(d) instead it does a reset(?)
# Make stage/unstage coloring correct
# Make staged changes the 2nd Secondary window or add ability to scrollUp/DownSecondaryPanel
# n-N sometimes doesn't work properly on Staged/unstaged
# Investigate github browse commit/branch and PR, create a PR flow
# Check dropping lines, drop all changes(incl staged) or drop unstaged changes
# NOTE: read git-clif and git-flow integration with lazygit
